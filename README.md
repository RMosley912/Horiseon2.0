# Horiseon2.0

##Rework Of Horiseon Social Solutions Services Homepage

-I completed this project to add some much needed accessibility elements to Horiseon's homepage, allowing search engines and screen readers
to better describe the content of the webpage.



## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines





 ## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title






## Tasks Completed

-Upon viewing the code, 

1. I eliminated outdated/non-semantic elements frome the HTML

2. I consolidating redundencies in the CSS file

3. I ensured that images were described with alt-text for screen readers

4.  I ensured that the HMTL and CSS had a logical, sequential order of elements and classes

5. I included a more descriptive name for the website
